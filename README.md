## Overview

Apps Script in IDE (ASIDE) supports modern, robust and scalable Apps Script development by providing a framework for a local coding environment capable of formatting, linting, testing and much more.

Here are the main features:

- **TypeScript**

  Write your code in TypeScript. It will be automatically compiled and bundled when deploying

- **Formatting / Linting**

  Leverage the power of ESLint and Prettier to enforce a unique coding style amongst collaborators

- **Testing**

  Use Jest to test your code before deploying

- **Multiple Environments**

  Seemlessly switch between `dev` and `prod` environments to push your code to

## Getting Started

The simplest way to get started is:

```
npx @google/aside init
```

## What it does

After running the `init` command above, ASIDE will go ahead and do the following:

- **Add configuration files**

  E.g. for ESLint, Prettier, Jest, ...

- **Set convenience scripts in package.json**

  Those scripts include: `lint`, `build` and `deploy`, among others

- **Install necessary dependencies**

  Everything required for formatting, linting, testing, etc. will be installed automatically

- **Set up clasp**

  ASIDE is using [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) to pull and push code from and to Apps Script

## Options

You can provide the `init` command with some convenience options:

- `--yes` / `-y`

  Answer 'yes' to all prompts

- `--no` / `-n`

  Answer 'no' to all prompts

- `--title`/ `-t`

  Set project title without being asked for it

- `--script-dev`

  Set Script ID for dev environment without being asked for it

- `--script-prod`

  Set Script ID for production environment without being asked for it

## Troubleshooting

### Unknown token 'export'

While bundling generally resolves all `export`s and `import`s it keeps `export`s in the entrypoint causing `clasp` to fail pushing. This can be an issue for example if you're trying to export functions from `index.ts` for testing.

The recommended approach is to use the entrypoint (`index.ts`) only to expose global functions to Apps Script while importing all business logic from separate modules.

### Module not included in bundle

Bundling includes treeshaking of unused files to keep the bundle size as small as possible. If any of your modules contain only global functions with no import-path leading to the entrypoint (e.g. to be called from the menu), those would not be included in the bundle.

To avoid this, you can use the following workaround:

Export a dummy variable from your module:

```ts
export const dummy = null;
```

Import and call the dummy variable in your entrypoint:

```ts
import { dummy } from './path/to/module';

dummy;
```

As long as anything from a file is being used, the entire file will be kept.
